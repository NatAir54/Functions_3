# Functions.

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with loop statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _30 min_.

### Description
Please, proceed to [`FunctionsTask`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/FunctionsTask3.java) class
and implement its static methods:

---

* `int multiArithmeticElements(int a1, int t, int n)`\
Task 3.
Create function MultiArithmeticElements, which determines the multiplication of the first n elements
of arithmetic progression of real numbers with a given initial element of progression a1 and progression
step t. an is calculated by the formula (an+1 = an + t).

###  Example:
For `a1 = 5, t = 3, n = 4` multiplication equals to 5*8*11*14 = 6160
